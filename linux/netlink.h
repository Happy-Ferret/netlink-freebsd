/*
 * Some mbuf pkthdr fields have special meaning when used with netlink:
 *
 *	FIELD	MACRO		DESCRIPTION
 *
 * 	rcvif	_MA()		linear buffer, possibly external
 *	fibnum	_ML()		linear buffer length
 *	len	--		current write offset
 *	flowid	NETLINK_CB()	src_portid, 32 bit
 *	rsstype	_MP()		protocol (NETLINK_GENERIC etc.)
 *
 * In more detail:
 *
 * 1. netlink messages are built incrementally in a linear buffer of
 * predefined size. This is a poor match with mbuf chains,
 * which may be split and have no predefined size.
 * Hence we use two mbuf fields (see above, _MA() and _ML() )
 * for the linear buffer pointer and max len,
 * and use m_pkthdr.len to record the space used so far
 * (remember of course to copy back and fix things before sending).
 * These are abstracted by the three macros _MA)(), _ML() and _MC()
 * _MA() and _ML() are cleared when passing the buffer back to the kernel
 *
 * 2. The protocol is mapped through _MP(m) into rsstype, and is used
 * in netlink_input()
 *
 * 3. sk_buff have a 48-byte "control buffer" (cb) to carry aux info.
 * In netlink this is wrapped by NETLINK_CB() into a pointer to a
 * struct netlink_skb_parms.
 * We need at least the portid, the source port for
 * messages coming from userspace, which in turn is used to locate the
 * destination socket when building a reply.
 * Netlink messages do not need flowid, so we store the portid there.
